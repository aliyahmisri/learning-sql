#Given there are 2 tables in database; 

#1 Table 1 which has details of customer order: customer_order
#2 Table 2 which has details of customer details: customer_details

Notes:
#1 The common key between the two tables are customer_id which we are required to use when joining the two tables (ON cd.customer_id = co.customer_id)
#2 The naming of table (eg: customer_order co) can be anything as it is a label for a reference when you choose columns from which table that you want to extract.

#LEFT JOIN

SELECT
co.customer_id,
cd.customer_name,
cd.customer_phone_number
co.order_number,

FROM customer_order co
LEFT JOIN customer_details cd ON cd.customer_id = co.customer_id
